üèà The Perfect FBS College Football Schedule

Welcome to my research project focused on building the Perfect FBS College Football Schedule. This project seeks to rethink the way college football schedules are created by removing strength of schedule bias, conference favoritism, and other unfair advantages that exist in the current system. Through analysis, iteration, and thoughtful experimentation, I aim to develop a model that delivers a fair and balanced schedule for all 134 FBS teams.
üéØ Project Goal

The goal is to create a scheduling system that:

    Ensures Fairness: Every team has an equal shot at success.
    Eliminates Bias: No team benefits from conference affiliation, strength of schedule perceptions, or geographic favoritism.
    Preserves Tradition: Historic rivalries (e.g., Alabama vs Auburn) are maintained in a way that enhances the excitement of the season.
    Maximizes Balance: Equally weighted conference and non-conference matchups without repetition of opponents or unfair travel burdens.

üìñ Why This Matters

The current FBS scheduling system suffers from:

    Strength of Schedule Bias: Some teams play tougher opponents, artificially boosting or harming their playoff chances.
    Conference Bias: Power conferences dominate, while Group of Five programs are excluded from fair playoff opportunities.
    Uneven Matchups: Certain teams schedule weak out-of-conference opponents to inflate their win totals.
    Rivalry Dilution: Traditional rivalries are sometimes neglected or overshadowed by conference realignment.

üî¨ Research & Methodology

This project focuses on iterative development and experimentation:

    Data Collection: Gather detailed information about FBS teams, including:
        Schools: Names, locations, enrollments, and nicknames.
        Current Conferences: Existing conference alignments (e.g., SEC, Big Ten).
        Former Conferences: Historical affiliations that add context to out-of-conference scheduling.
        Rivalries: Traditional rivalries that must be prioritized.

    Scheduling Rules:
        Every team plays 12 games with 3 bye weeks.
        A designated "Rivalry Week" ensures teams play their top rival.
        Equal weighting for:
            Conference games (3-5 per team).
            Out-of-conference games (3-5 per team), prioritizing teams with shared former conferences.
        No team plays more than one game per week.
        No team faces the same opponent twice in a season.

    Iterations:
        Start with simple schedule generation.
        Incorporate rivalries and former conference relationships.
        Refine to balance travel distances, geographic fairness, and game diversity.

    Testing Fairness:
    Evaluate fairness by analyzing:
        Frequency of matchups across multiple iterations.
        Consistency in opponent strength without bias.
        Travel distance balance between teams.

    Documentation:
    I will document each idea, iteration, and adjustment I make during the process.

‚öôÔ∏è Progress So Far

    Data Preparation:
        Schools and rivalries have been mapped using real-world FBS data.
        Traditional rivalries (e.g., Alabama-Auburn, Army-Navy) are accounted for.

    Schedule Generation:
        Successfully generated a 12-game schedule for:
            Random FBS teams.
            Specific conferences (e.g., SEC).
        Designed "Rivalry Week" to ensure all teams play their rivals on the same week.

    Rule Implementation:
        Enforced single-game matchups and 3 evenly spaced bye weeks.

üöß Next Steps

    Expand Rules: Introduce travel constraints to ensure fairness in out-of-conference games.
    Group of Five Integration: Balance Power conferences and Group of Five matchups for playoff inclusivity.
    Historical Context: Prioritize games with historic conference ties to preserve traditions.
    Simulation Testing: Run multiple simulations to test schedule fairness and consistency.
    Fan Input: Incorporate feedback on rivalry preservation and fairness.

üí° Future Enhancements

    Explore travel constraints to ensure geographic fairness.
    Develop a visual tool for schedule visualization and analysis.
    Test models to ensure all teams have an equal probability of making playoffs.
    Consider user-defined constraints (e.g., custom rivalry settings or conference rules).

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

    Python: Core scheduling logic and data manipulation.
    Pandas: Handling large datasets efficiently.
